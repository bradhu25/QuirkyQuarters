Executive Summary

	Quirky Quarters addresses the common hassle of managing finances during social outings. Our app streamlines expense tracking, bill splitting, and financial insights for a seamless and enjoyable experience with friends.
	Friends often face challenges in splitting bills accurately and tracking shared expenses during social gatherings. The rising demand for seamless financial management in social settings creates a significant market gap. Quirky Quarters provides a user-friendly app with features like receipt uploads, Venmo integration, and a finance tracker. Our solution eliminates the need for manual calculations, making bill splitting and expense tracking effortless. We want to capture the social finance market, with a focus on tech-savvy millennials and young adults, as we recognize the need for simplicity in financial interactions among friends during social activities.
	While there are apps like Tab and Splitwise that tap into the same market, neither offers the cohesive experience we hope to provide. Users will be able to upload pictures of their receipts for immediate itemized lists where friends can claim and/or share their items. In the case where there is no receipt available, we plan to include a manual option to input expenses and split across as many friends as desired. Our app will fully integrate Venmo and Zelle payments to make payments quick and easy. Apart from facilitating social interactions, users will also have the ability to track their expenses to better understand their spending habits. Through Quirky Quarters, they will be able to classify their expenses into different categories and craft personal and/or shared budgets.
Quirky Quarters stands out with its tailored focus on social finance, offering a unique and dedicated solution. Our basic business model is primarily B2C, with potential for B2B partnerships in the future. In essence, Quirky Quarters aims to revolutionize social finance, providing a tailored solution for friends to effortlessly manage their expenses and enjoy each other's company without the financial fuss.
